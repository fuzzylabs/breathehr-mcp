> A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI assistants secure access to your Breathe HR data - employees, absences, and company information.

## What This Does

This MCP server lets your AI assistant (like Claude) directly access your Breathe HR account to:

- üë• **Browse employees** - Get employee lists, search by name/department, view detailed profiles
- üèñÔ∏è **Manage absences** - Check leave balances, view absence history, submit leave requests
- üè¢ **Access company data** - View account info, departments, and organizational structure
- üîç **Smart search** - Find employees and data using natural language queries

Perfect for HR teams, managers, and anyone who needs quick access to people data through their AI assistant.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Breathe HR API Key

1. Log into your Breathe HR account
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **API**
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (you'll need it in step 3)

### 2. Install & Configure

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/fuzzylabs/breathehr-mcp.git
cd breathehr-mcp
uv sync

# Set up your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Breathe HR API key
```

### 3. Connect to Your AI Assistant

**For Claude Desktop**, add this to your config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "breathe-hr": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "breathe_hr_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BREATHE_HR_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Config file locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**For Cursor**, add this to your settings:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "breathe-hr": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "breathe_hr_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BREATHE_HR_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Using!

Restart your AI assistant and try asking:

- *"Show me all employees in the Engineering department"*
- *"Who has pending leave requests?"*
- *"Create a holiday request for John Doe from March 1-5"*
- *"Search for employees named Sarah"*
- *"What's our current employee count?"*

## What You Can Access

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" Error

**Check your API key:**
1. Verify the key in your `.env` file matches your Breathe HR settings
2. Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key
3. Confirm your API key has the necessary permissions

### "MCP server not found" in AI Assistant

**Restart and check config:**
1. Restart your AI assistant completely
2. Verify the JSON config syntax is correct (no trailing commas)
3. Check the file path points to the right location
4. Make sure `uv` is installed and in your PATH

### "Rate limit exceeded" Error

**Breathe HR has API limits:**
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Reduce the frequency of requests
- Contact Breathe HR support if limits are too low

### Testing Connection

```bash
# Test the server directly
cd breathehr-mcp
uv run python -m breathe_hr_mcp

# Validate your configuration
uv run python scripts/validate-configs.py

# Check available tools
uv run python scripts/print_mcp_routes.py
```
